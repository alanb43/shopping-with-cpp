# Shopping with C++

#### This project takes in input representing information regarding a number of stores, their inventories, and items on the user's shopping list. 

***

#### The project showcases some of my first uses of structs and maps, which were used frequently for data storage and manipulation, and uses some STL Algorithms. 

#### My program finds the stores that sells each item on my shopping list and determines the price that I would pay based on purchasing from the stores with the best deals, as well as based on their inventory's stock quantity and which other stores I would have to go to in order to fulfill what I need on my shopping list.

#### This was a fun project that I did my best to refactor and make abstract, creating many functions and keeping my main function short and sweet. It was a great way to start using structs, constructors, and algorithms, and I can't wait to learn more about these things to make more complex programs in the future.
